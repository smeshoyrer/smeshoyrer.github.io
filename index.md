# Samuel Meshoyrer

I am a software developer at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and an MSc student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I'm interested in how we can build smarter networks. Right now, I'm studying study how queueing theory and probability models can be applied to the analysis of software systems.
