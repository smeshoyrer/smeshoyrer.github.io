# About Me

I am a software developer at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and an MSc student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I'm interested in how queueing theory and probability models can inform the design of distributed systems. 

This summer, I'm assisting in teaching a new course at Columbia University, [*C++ for C Programmers*](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4995/).
