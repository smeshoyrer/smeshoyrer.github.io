# About Me

I am a software engineer at [Google](https://google.com/) and an MSc student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. I'm interested in how queueing theory and stochastic models can inform the design of distributed systems. 

In the past, I've assisted in teaching a number of courses at Columbia University, including [*C++ for C Programmers*](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4995/).
